#### Log number 3
Going to probably make these 


Updated working list:
- Figure out how to do the blog
  - make a primary blog post to discuss the blog's/website's purpose
  - add a cat pics section
  - add something for the china vacation
  - ~~clean up the default given blog entries. I was thinking of making a separate section to look at these, or maybe just link to the original website at that point. Once I copy enough from the posts and figure out what I'm doing i might just make my own documentation and remove the default posts entirely.~~ (Note: I ended up moving all of the posts to a separate junk folder. I still want to look at them for reference.)
  - ~~figure out how the tags and categories work~~
- Fix up the main page
- go to _themes.scss and set my own color theme
  - change the color of the footer. It's too bright.
  - change the color of the highlight. Blue is alright but I could do orange or something else.
- create a "school" section where I can make a collection
- set up some of the previous "projects" i've done
- set up an archive of more private posts
- set up a CV
- figure out how the "check for broken links" workflow keeps breaking. It has something to do with `demo.html` in the default template's blog post `distill.md`.
- ~~Fix up all the submenus. Might get rid of some pages, or archive them because *maybe* i might re-include them depending on where i go!~~
- ~~Fix up the repository page~~

Here's a bit of a test on including some photos in the blog. Consider the current screenshots of the developing blog as a test on how I'll include images in the future.
