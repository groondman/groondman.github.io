#### HELLO!
uhhh what is this blog even about??
actually this page is mostly a test to see how i can make a new post.

Currently this is what's on the working list: (*maybe a bit ambitious*)
- [ ] Figure out how to do the blog
  - [ ] Also figure out how the tags and categories work
  - [ ] add a cat pics section
  - [ ] add something for the china vacation
  - [ ] clean up the default given blog entries. I was thinking of making a separate section to look at these, or maybe just link to the original website at that point. Once I copy enough from the posts and figure out what I'm doing i might just make my own documentation and remove the default posts entirely.
- [ ] Fix up all the submenus. Might get rid of some pages, or archive them because *maybe* i might re-include them depending on where i go!
- [ ] Fix up the main page
- [ ] Fix up the repository
- [ ] way more that i can't think of off of the top of my head!
