#### back for more
so the test worked out quite well! overall everything going slowly, since turns out finding something to write about and actually thinking about HOW to write it are two separate obstacles, things are going slower than I expected, but things are going well enough that this site should be set up by the time i go on vacation!

Here's an updated working list:
- Figure out how to do the blog
  - ~~figure out how the tags and categories work~~
  - add a cat pics section
  - add something for the china vacation
  - ~~clean up the default given blog entries. I was thinking of making a separate section to look at these, or maybe just link to the original website at that point. Once I copy enough from the posts and figure out what I'm doing i might just make my own documentation and remove the default posts entirely.~~ (Note: I ended up moving all of the posts to a separate junk folder. I still want to look at them for reference.)
  - make a primary blog post to discuss the blog's/website's purpose
- ~~Fix up all the submenus. Might get rid of some pages, or archive them because *maybe* i might re-include them depending on where i go!~~
- Fix up the main page (looking pretty empty now)
- ~~Fix up the repository page~~
- go to _themes.scss and set my own color theme
- create a "school" section where I can make a collection
- set up some of the previous "projects" i've done
- set up a CV
- set up an archive of more private posts
- way more that i can't think of off of the top of my head!

Some notes:
- since i forked a template off of github, going into this i basically had NO clue what i was doing. So figuring out how the tags and categories were featured in the blog's main page took forever! Thankfully someone asked this question to the people making the template, so if i checked there first i would've probably saved one or two hours of my life finding out how this stuff worked.
- I removed most of the default pages that the template provided. Here's what I removed:
  - **publications** </br>Since I'm not a PhD student or some kind of fancy student, I don't have any use for this.
  - **cv** </br>This one's actually a work in progress. I currently have this in a lower end of the priority list and I don't know when I'll get this done, so I'll hide this page for the time being.
  - **dropdown** </br>There was a dropdown menu in the top navigation bar and I removed it. It was part of the template to show how you can add a dropdown, but otherwise it didn't contribute to my current page.
  - **repositories** </br>This one is just some kind of tracker to show off your Github stats. Fun fact: I do not have Github stats to show off. 
  - **profiles** </br>This page is used to show off a research team and its members' profiles. I'm not in a research team. This further supports my belief that this template is made for research students who need to advertise themselves.
